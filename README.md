# conways-game-of-life
conway's game of life, implemented in as many languages as I can (currently in bounded board)

every implementation will ask the user toprovide the following:
1. size n for the board (nXn)
2. probability for cell to be alive at the beggining of the game
3. time interval in miliseconds between updates
